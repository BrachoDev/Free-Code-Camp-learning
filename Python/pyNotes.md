## Comments

Comments are written using `#` in Python.

```Python
# This is a comment.
```

## Print in Terminal

- Use the `print()` function to display text in the terminal.

  Input:

  ```python
  print("Hellow world!")
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  Hello World!
  ```

  Notice we use `strings` to print words.

- There are print modifiers that can allow us to put `"quotation marks"` to our print message.

  1. We can use `''` or `""`

     ```python
     print('She said, "Hello, Carlos!"')
     ```

  2. We can use `\\`

     ```python
     print("She said, \"Hello, Carlos!\"")
     ```

- If we want to `print()` a `string` with another data type, we need to use `str()`

  Example:

  ```python
  name = False
  if name == False:
      name = True

  print('name is ' +str(name))
  #output: name is True
  ```

- We can separate lines by adding `\n` to the string

  ```python
  print("hola!\nComo estas?")
  #output
  #Hola!
  #Como estas?
  ```

### F-Strings

In order to avoid using variable converters to print different variable types in one print, we can use an f-string like so:

```python
score = 0
height = 1.75
is_winning = True
print(f"Your score is {score} and your height is {height}. Are you winning ? {is_winning}")
#output: Your score is 0 and your height is 1.75. Are you winning ? True
```

## Input function

This is a function similar to `print()`. However, it allows an user to input data.

```python
name = input("what is your name?")
print("Nice to meet you " +name)
# this will show a message asking for name. then, it will show a message with the input assigned
```

### Calculate number of letter in a String

To calculate the number of letter in a string we can use the `len()` function.

```python
print(len("brachodev"))
#output: 9
```

## Indentation

Python uses indentation to define blocks of code instead of using curly braces or keywords like other languages do.

Example:

```python
x = 1
if x == 1
    #indentation to four spaces
    print("x is 1")
```

## Arithmetic Operations

- `+` for addition

  - We can use `+=` to sum a number to a variable

    ```python
    score = 0
    # User scores a point
    score += 1
    #output: score is now 1
    ```

- `-` for substraction

  - We can use `-=` to substract a number to a variable

    ```python
    score = 1
    # User loses a point
    score -= 1
    #output: score is now 0
    ```

- `*` for multiplication

  - We can also use `*=` to multiply a variable by a number

    ```python
    number = 2 + 2
    number *= 2
    #output: number = 8
    ```

- `/` for division

  - we can also use `/=` to divide a variable by an specific number

    ```python
    result = 4/2
    result /= 2
    #output is 1
    ```

- `%` for modulus (returns the remainder)
- `**` for exponentiation

## Variables

- A variable is a container for a value that behaves as the value that it contains.

  For Example:

  ```python
  name = "Carlos"
  print("Hello " +name)
  # output: Hello Carlos
  ```

### Naming Variables

- When naming variables we can add multiple word by separating them with `_` Example: `This_Example`

- We can also put number; however, we can only put them at the end of the name, not the beginning.

```python
variable1 = 1
```

- We cannot have spaces in between word to name variable like `bad example`. This will create a syntax error.

### Check Variable's Data Type

To check the data type of a variable we can use the `type` function

```python
name = "Carlos"
print(type(name))
# output: <class 'str'>
```

### Assing multiple variables

We can assign multiple variables in one line of code this way:

```python
name, age, attractive = "Carlos", 25, True
print(name)
print(age)
print(attractive)

# Output:
# Carlos
# 25
# True
```

## Data Types

A variable can have `string`, `integer`, `float` or `boolean`

### String

- A `string` is text and uses `"quotation"`

  ```python
  last_name = "Bracho"
  ```

- We can select a specific letter from the string by performing a `substric` by using `[]`

  ```python
  print("Hello"[0])
  #output: H
  ```

  Note: the first position is always `[0]`.

- We can count the number of time a value appears in a string by using `count()`

example:

```python
name = "carlos bracho"
count = name.count("r")
#output: 2
```

- to change letter to lower case we can use `lower()`

Example:

```python
name = "CARLOS BrachO"
lower_case = name.lower()
#output: carlos bracho
```

- We can split a strin into a list of substrings by using the `.split()` method.

Example:

### Integer

- A `integer` is just a value like `1, 2, 3.....n`.

  ```python
  Age = 25
  ```

- We can also visualize large number better if we put `_` in between number

  ```python
  number = 123456789
  number1 = 123_456_789
  # number = number1 (both variables have the same number)
  ```

### Float

- A `float` is a floating point number (a decimal number)

  ```python
  pi = 3.14159
  ```

- If we want to round up our `float` numbers, we can use the `round()` function.

  ```python
  round(8/3)
  #output: 3 instead of 2.6666666666666665
  ```

- We can also specify the number of decimals we want in our result when rounding numbers by adding a `,n`.

  ```python
  round(8/3,2)
  #output: 2.67 only using two decimals
  ```

- If we only want the number before the decimals, we can use `//` instead. This also transform the `float` number into an `integer`

  ```python
  8 // 3
  #output: 2 eliminating decimal spaces
  ```

### Boolean

- A `boolean` value is `True` or `False`

  ```python
  name_manuel = False
  ```

### Data Type Conversion:

We can modify the type of data for each variable using different functions for each data type.

- To change a variable's data type to a `string`, we use `str(insert_variable)`
- To change a variable's data type to an `int`, we use `int(variable)`
- To change a variable's data type to a `float`, we use `float()`

## Data Structures:

Data struture is a way to organize data in Python.

There are 4 basic python data structures:

### `set`:

An unordered collection of items.

```python
{1, 2, 3}, { 'First name', 'Last name' }
```

### `list`:

An ordered collection of changeable items. Two-dimensional arrays can be formed from lists of lists. They use brackets `[]`

Examples:

```python
fruits = [item1, item2]
```

```python
[1, 2, 3], ['Height', 6.1], [ [1, 2], [3, 4] ]
```

- to select an specific value in a list we can do so by using the variable, brackets and the position were the value is in the list.

  Example:

  ```python
  states_of_america = ["Delaware", "Pennsylvania", "Florida"]
  print(states_of_america[2])
  #OR
  print(states_of_america[-1])
  #Output: Florida
  ```

- To add a value to the list we can use the function `.append()`

  Example:

  ```python
  states_of_america = ["Delaware", "Pennsylvania", "Florida"]
  states_of_america.append("Bracholand")
  print(states_of_america)
  #output ['Delaware', 'Pennsylvania', 'Florida', 'Bracholand']
  ```

- to add multiple values we use `.extend()`

  Example:

  ```python
  states_of_america = ["Delaware", "Pennsylvania", "Florida"]
  states_of_america.extend(["Bracholand", "Camille Land"])
  print(states_of_america)
  #Output: ['Delaware', 'Pennsylvania', 'Florida', 'Bracholand', 'Camille Land']
  ```

- We can use nested list to combine lists. This is basically lists inside a bigger list.

Example:

```python
fruits = ["Strawberries", "Nectarines", "Apples"]
vegetables = ["Spinach", "kale", "Tomatoes"]
combination = [fruits, vegetables]
print(combination)
#[['Strawberries', 'Nectarines', 'Apples'], ['Spinach', 'kale', 'Tomatoes']]
```

### `tuple`:

An ordered collection of unchangeable items.

```python
(1, 2, 3), ('Hello', 'World')
```

### `dictionary` or `dict`:

A collection of mappings between keys and values.

```python
{'Home': '310-555-5555', 'Office': '951-555-5555'}, {'C': 'do', 'D': 're', 'E': 'mi', 'F': 'fa', 'G': 'sol'}
```

## Control flow and logical Operators

### Comparison Operators:

This is a list of all the available operators used in logical operators:

- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than ot equal to
- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to

### if / else

To create conditions that tells what to do when certain situations are present, we use `if` and `else`

Example:

```python
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height >= 120:
  print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
```

- NOTE: it is important to put the indentation after each condition. This is similar to adding `{}` ot `[]` in Javascript's conditions.

### Nested if and else statements:

If we want to check for multiple conditions, we can nest `if / else` statements inside another one to add that extra condition.

Example:

```python
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height >= 120:
  print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
  age = int(input("What is your age? "))
  if age <= 18:
    print("Please pay $7.")
  else:
    print("Please pay $12.")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
```

- In addition, we can use `if/elif/else` to add multiple conditions:

Example:

```python
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height >= 120:
  print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
  age = int(input("What is your age? "))
  if age <12:
    print("Please pay $5.")
  elif age <= 18:
    print("Please pay $7.")
  else:
    print("Please pay $12.")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
```

### Multiple If Statements in Succession:

We can use multiple `if`, `else`, `elif` and variables inside `if` statements to add other conditions within our programs.

Example:

```python
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
bill = 0

if height >= 120:
  print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
  age = int(input("What is your age? "))
  if age < 12:
    bill = 5
    print("Child tickets are $5.")
  elif age <= 18:
    bill = 7
    print("Youth tickets are $7.")
  else:
    bill = 12
    print("Adult tickets are $12.")

  wants_photo = input("Do you want a photo taken? Y or N. ")
  if wants_photo == "Y":
    bill += 3

  print(f"Your final bill is ${bill}")

else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
```

### Logical Operators

Instead of using multiple `if` statements, we can use logical operators to check for multiple conditions in one line of code.

- List of logical operators:

  - A and B: Both conditions must be true to pass
  - C or D: One of the conditions must be true to pass
  - not E: It reverses the condition. If it is true, it changes it to false and viceversa.

  Example;

  ```python
  print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
  height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
  bill = 0

  if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
    age = int(input("What is your age? "))
    if age < 12:
      bill = 5
      print("Child tickets are $5.")
    elif age <= 18:
      bill = 7
      print("Youth tickets are $7.")
    elif age >= 45 and age <= 55: #logical operator `and`
      print("Everything is going to be ok. Have a free ride on us!")
    else:
      bill = 12
      print("Adult tickets are $12.")

    wants_photo = input("Do you want a photo taken? Y or N. ")
    if wants_photo == "Y":
      bill += 3

    print(f"Your final bill is ${bill}")

  else:
    print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
  ```

## Random Module

We can create random `int` or `float` using the `random` module that was create by the Python team to make it easier for developers to create random values. In order to do so, we have to `import` the random module.

- `random.randint(x,y)` creates a random `integer` between two number `x` and `y`

Example:

```python
import random

a = random.randint(0,10)

print(a)
# Output: a random number between 0 and 10.
```

- `random.random()` creates a random `float` between `0` and `1` but never 1.

Example:

```python
import random

a = random.random() * 5
print(a)
#Output: a number between 0 and 4.999999 but not 5
```

- We can create modules ourselves by creating other python files. In the new python file, we can create variables or other things that can be reused in other python files. that way we can save time and make coding easier

## Common Python data visualization and analysis tools

- `numpy` or `np` is used for `Mathematical functions, required by other libraries` --> [Documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/)

- `scipy.stats` or `st` is used for `Statistical functions` --> [Documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html)

- `pandas` or `pd` is used for `Data frames, statistical functions	` --> [Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)

- `matplotlib.pyplot` or `plt` is used for `Data visualization` --> [Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html)

- `scikit-learn` or `sks` is used for `Machine learning and data analysis` --> [Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)

- `seaborn` or `sns` is used for `Data visualization` -->[Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

- `quandl` is used for `Data analysis` -->[Documentation](https://docs.data.nasdaq.com/v1.0/docs/python-installation)

## Loops

### Using the for loop with Python lists

A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of items in an automated way.

Example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits: #fruit represents each item in the fruits list
  print(fruit)
```

This code will print:

```
apple
banana
cherry
```

### for loops and the range() function

The `range()` function in Python is a handy tool for generating sequences of numbers. It's particularly useful when you're working with loops, as it allows you to easily iterate through a specific range of numbers.

Example:

```python
for number in range(1,10):# it excludes the last digit
    print(number)
```

Output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

- We can also create a step which skips a set number of items in the list:

  Example:

  ```python
  for number in range(1,11,3):
      print(number)
  ```

  Output:

  ```
  1
  4
  7
  10
  ```

### While loops

- These types of loops will do something while a certain condition is true.

  Example: 
    ```python
    i = 0
    while i <= 10:
        print(i)
        i += 1
    ```
  Output:
    ```python
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10
    ```
## Functions

### Defining functions:

- We can create our own functions by using `def` and giving it a name like `my_function()`

- It is very similar to loops were the instructions are located indented under `def`

  Example:

  ```python
  def my_function():
    print('Hello User')

    my_function() # We have to call in the function if we want it to work
  ### This will output the messafe 'Hello User'
  ```

### Functions with inputs:

- We can pass a value inside the parethesis `()` in a function, so we can change its value everytime we run our function.

  Example:
  ```python
  def greet_with_name(name):
    print(f'Hello {name}')
    print(f"How do you do {name}?")
  greet_with_name('Carlos')
  ```
  ```python
  Output: 
    Hello Carlos
    How do you do Carlos?
  ```

- the variable `inside_the(parethesis)` is callaed a `parameter`. The value we give it when the function is called is named `argument`.
