### Difference between interpreter and Compiler [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C5AHaS1mOA)

- JavaScript is an interpreter

- This is how JS code look like:

  ![JavaScript look](assets\images\JS-look.png)

### Data Types:

#### 1. Strings:

- It contains text. This is how it looks like:

  ```javascript
  alert("hello"); // "hello" is the string data.
  ```

- Strings Concatenation:

  ```javascript
  var message = "Hello";
  var name = "Carlos";

  //Write you code below this line:

  alert(message + " " + name + "!"); // Outputs in Console: Hello Carlos!
  ```

- String feature `.length` challenge answer:

  (Create an alert that shows how many characters we typed and how many left after 280 characters.)

  ```javascript
  var text = prompt("Enter your Text here");
  var numberOfText = text.length;
  var remaining = 280 - numberOfText;

  alert(
    "You have written " +
      numberOfText +
      " characters, you have " +
      remaining +
      " left."
  );
  ```

- Feature `.slice(x,y)` challenge answer:

  (Create an alert that shows a max of 140 characters)

  ```javascript
  var text = prompt("Enter your text here");
  alert(text.slice(0, 140));
  ```

- Feature `.toUppercase()` and `.toLowerCase()` methods challenge answers:

  (Create an alert that shows the name of the person in the correct form Example: Carlos OR Bracho)

  ```javascript
  var name = prompt("What is your name?");
  firstLetter = name.slice(0, 1).toUpperCase();
  remainingLetters = name.slice(1, name.length).toLowerCase();

  alert("Hello, " + firstLetter + remainingLetters + " !");
  ```

#### 2. Numbers:

- It represents numerical values.

```javascript
1,2,3... // These are numbers data.
```

- To put long formulas in JS, we need to use the same logic as calculators.

  (Create an alert that calculates the age of dogs in human years)

  ```javascript
  var dogAge = prompt("Enter your dog's age");
  var humanAge = (dogAge - 2) * 4 + 21;
  alert("Your dog is " + humanAge + " in human years !");
  ```

- We can increment or decrement values by 1 using `++` and `--`.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  var x = 5;
  x++; //x is now = 6
  var y = 5;
  y--; //y is now = 4
  ```

- If we want to increase or decrease by more than 1, we can use `+=` or `-=` operators.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  var x = 5;
  x += 2; //x is now = 7
  var y = 5;
  y -= 2; //y is now = 3
  ```

#### 3. Boolean:

- Data type that describe data to be either `True` or `False`

### Variables:

![Variable image](assets\images\variables.png)

- Example of variable:

  ```javascript
  var myName = "Carlos";
  var yourName = prompt("What is your name?");
  alert(
    "My name is " +
      myName +
      ", welcome to this learning project " +
      yourName +
      " !"
  ); //This code creates a message  box with a personalized greeting. Which shows how  we can use variables in alerts.
  ```

- Javascript Variables Exercise:

  Change the variables so a = "8" and b = "3".

  Do NOT change any of the existing code.

  You are NOT allowed to type any numbers.

  You should NOT redeclare the variables a and b.

  ```javascript
  var a = "3";
  var b = "8";

  /***********Do not change the code above ðŸ‘†*******/
  //Write your code on lines 7 - 9:
  var c = a;
  a = b;
  b = c;
  /***********Do not change the code below ðŸ‘‡*******/

  console.log("a is " + a);
  console.log("b is " + b);
  //this changes the values so a = "8" and b = "3"
  ```

- Correct ways to name variables in JS:

  ```javascript
  var my123 = 123;
  var myName = "Carlos";
  var my_name = "Carlos";
  var useScoreFinal = 12; // This is the best way because it includes camelCase.
  ```

### Functions:

![function look](assets\images\function-look.png)

- `alert()` will show as a pop up on the website while `console.log()` will print out the message in the console, and it is usually used by the developer.

- Within the the functions, we can add inputs:

  ```javascript
  function nameOfFunction(input) {}
  ```

  This is an example:
  ![input example](assets\images\input-example.png)

  As we can see bottles will be replaced by two, telling the program to get two bottles and calculating the `cost`

  - Exercise: Using this information, create a code that calculates the amount of bottles that can be bought.

  ```javascript
  function getMilk(money) {
    console.log("leaveHouse");
    console.log("moveRight");
    console.log("moveRight");
    console.log("moveUp");
    console.log("moveUp");
    console.log("moveUp");
    console.log("moveUp");
    console.log("moveRight");
    console.log("moveRight");

    var bottles = Math.floor(money / 1.5);

    console.log("buy " + bottles + " bottles of milk");
    console.log("moveLeft");
    console.log("moveLeft");
    console.log("moveDown");
    console.log("moveDown");
    console.log("moveDown");
    console.log("moveDown");
    console.log("moveLeft");
    console.log("moveLeft");
    console.log("enterHouse");
  }
  getMilk(5);
  ```

- The `Math.floor()` method rounds a number _DOWN_ to the nearest integer

- Exercise: Calculate the remaining months, weeks and days if the max age is 90.

  ```javascript
  function lifeInWeeks(age) {
    /************Don't change the code above************/

    var remainingYears = 90 - age;

    var months = remainingYears * 12;
    var weeks = remainingYears * 52;
    var days = remainingYears * 365;

    console.log(
      "You have " +
        days +
        " days, " +
        weeks +
        " weeks, and " +
        months +
        " months left."
    );

    /*************Don't change the code below**********/
  }

  lifeInWeeks(25);
  ```

  console View:

  ```console
  You have 23725 days, 3380 weeks, and 780 months left.
  ```
