## Comments

Comments are written using `#` in Python.

```Python
# This is a comment.
```

## Print in Terminal

Use the `print()` function to display text in the terminal.

Input:

```python
print("Hellow world!")
```

Output:

```
Hello World!
```

## Indentation

Python uses indentation to define blocks of code instead of using curly braces or keywords like other languages do.

Example:

```python
x = 1
if x == 1
    #indentation to four spaces
    print("x is 1")
```

## Arithmetic Operations

- `+` for addition
- `-` for substraction
- `*` for multiplication
- `/` for division
- `%` for modulus (returns the remainder)
- `**` for exponentiation
